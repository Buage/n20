            <li>The date of creation</li>
            <li>The last 15 characters of the hashed IP</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Use of your data</h2>
        <p>By using n20, you allow us to store your URLs and handles in our database. We reserve the right to edit, disable, or delete any shortened link if necessary.</p>

        <h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>

        <h2>5. Changes to these terms</h2>
